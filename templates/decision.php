<p>Merge is the best way to find a time to meet. Simply sign in
with Google, create an event, and invite your friends, coworkers,
or arch enemies.</p>
<p>We do the rest of the work, finding a time that is free in all
of your Google Calendars and alerting you when we've found it. This
way, you can spend less time emailing and more time meeting!</p>
